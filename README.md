- 👋 Hi, I’m @NikolaDackovic
- 👀 I’m interested in in becoming a QA Automation tester, web development, and learning new technologies like Java, SQL, and Selenium.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning learning Selenium for automation, and working on a PRNG project for generating lottery combinations. Also mastering SQL with MySQL Workbench!  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on on projects related to web development, automation, and testing.
- 💻 I’m proficient in Java (💥 `public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println("Hello World!"); } }`) and SQL (🗃️ MySQL), and I use Jira for project management and bug tracking.
