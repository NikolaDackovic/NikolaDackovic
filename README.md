👋 Hi, I’m @NikolaDackovic
👀 I’m interested in becoming a Frontend Developer, web development, and learning new technologies like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React.
🌱 I’m currently learning frontend development, mastering JavaScript, and diving deeper into web design. Also working on various projects to improve my skills in creating dynamic websites!
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to frontend development, web design, and user experience (UX).
💻 I’m proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (💥 creating interactive websites and responsive designs), and I use GitHub for version control and collaboration.
📫 How to reach me: Drop me a line at dackovicnikola1@gmail.com 📩
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not coding, you can find me behind the lens of my Canon 80D 📸 or designing a custom 3D printed Dolce Gusto capsule holder (need a personalized gift? 😉)!
